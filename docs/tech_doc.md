# Technical Documentation for telegram bot with open GPT


## Overview

This code is a chatbot implementation using the OpenAI API and the aiogram library. The chatbot uses the "text-davinci-003" model from OpenAI to generate responses to text prompts. The code uses the aiogram library to handle interactions with the Telegram Bot API, allowing the chatbot to be used on Telegram.

## Technical Details

### OpenAI API

OpenAI is an AI research laboratory consisting of the for-profit technological company OpenAI LP and its parent company, the non-profit OpenAI Inc. The OpenAI API is a cloud-based service that provides access to OpenAI's advanced AI models, including language generation models. The "text-davinci-003" model used in this code is a language generation model that can complete a prompt to generate a response.

### aiogram Library

aiogram is a Python library for creating Telegram bots. It provides a convenient way to interact with the Telegram Bot API and handle incoming messages, updates, and commands. The code uses the aiogram library to handle interactions with the Telegram Bot API and provide an interface for the chatbot.

### Configuration

In order to run this code, you will need to obtain a bot token from BotFather on Telegram and an API key for OpenAI. The bot token and API key should be placed in a `config.py` file in the same directory as this code, as described in the "Configuration" section of the README.md file.

### Code Structure

The code begins by importing the required libraries: `openai`, `aiogram`, and `executor`. The OpenAI API key is set using the following line of code:

```python
openai.api_key = API_KEY
```

where `API_KEY` is the API key obtained from OpenAI. The code then creates a bot using the `Bot` class from the aiogram library, passing in the bot token obtained from BotFather as a parameter. The code also creates a dispatcher using the `Dispatcher` class from the aiogram library, passing in the bot as a parameter.

The code then defines a handler function, `send`, that is triggered whenever a message is received by the bot. This function generates a response to the message using the OpenAI API, and sends the response back to the user using the `answer` method of the `message` object.

Finally, the code starts the bot using the `start_polling` method of the `executor` module, passing in the dispatcher and the `skip_updates` parameter set to `True`. This starts the bot and makes it available for use.

## Conclusion

This code provides a basic implementation of a chatbot using the OpenAI API and the aiogram library. The chatbot uses the "text-davinci-003" model from OpenAI to generate responses to text prompts, and the aiogram library to handle interactions with the Telegram Bot API. The code is designed to be simple and easy to understand, and can be used as a starting point for more advanced chatbot projects.
